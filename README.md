## Description

This is an application that allows a social media startup to use an API that uses a NoSql database so that their website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Technologies

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Moment.js
- express.js

## Installation and Usage

When command `npm start` is run, then the server will start and the Mongoose models will be synced to the MongoDB databse. Using insomnia, I will open the API GET routes for users and thoughts and data for each of these thoughts will be displayed in formatted JSON and when the API POST, PUT and DELETE routes are tested, then I will be able to successfully create, update and delete users and thoughts as well as add and remove friends to a users list.
